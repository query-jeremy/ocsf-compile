# ocsf-compile

## TODO

- [x] DateTime synthetic profile
- [x] Derived _uid enums are being merged/shared and shouldn't be
- [x] Some _uid enum members are missing. See compliance_finding.type_uid, job_query.type_uid
- [x] Other enum members not being merged from dictionary.json. See detection_finding.action_id[99]
- [x] Captions for _name attributes that correspond with _uid/id attributes
- [x] Annotations
- [x] Profiles list should be appended to in inheritance
- [ ] Goofy global profiles like data_classification
- [ ] Sometimes profiles are set in a way that appears to be correct but are missing in the original. OCSF server bug?
- [ ] ntp_activity and tunnel_activity type_uid appears to be wrong in the OCSF server?
